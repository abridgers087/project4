    "Rat Data: Please note that if a property/taxlot does not appear in the file, that does not indicate an absence of rats - rather just that it has not been inspected. Similarly, neighborhoods with higher numbers properties with active rat signs may not actually have higher rat populations but simply have more inspections.\n",

    "Rat lifespan: rats live about 1 year and begin reproducing at 2-3 months old. New York City rats like to burrow, nest, and hide in soft dirt at ground level or below, and live in colonies, or families of 30 to 50 rats with 9 to a burrow. These rats will live between 100 and 400 feet from their food source, and in their lifetime will rarely travel more than 600 feet from where they are born (source:https://rattrapinc.com/new-york-city-rat-facts/).\n",

    "With this information, we should focus on a time span of not more than 5 years, but not less than 1-2 years. I also think we should focus on one Borough. Research shows Brooklyn to be the most rat-infested Borough (https://www.stat.cmu.edu/capstoneresearch/fall2022/315files_f22/team6.html) (plus our dataset shows the same). \n",
    "\n",
    "Using the data at hand, I beleive we should look at inspection results, by street name, over a period of 2-5 years to see if there is a trend in rat growth, if treatment is working, etc. Compare with the sightings data for more information.\n",
